.. _usage:

Using CAISAR
============

Commands summary
----------------

The CAISAR executable provide several subcommands, called
using ``caisar [COMMAND]``. ``caisar --help`` provides a list of
all available commands. Additionally, ``caisar [COMMAND] --help`` gives a synopsis for each available command.

.. _prover-registration:

Prover registration
-------------------

CAISAR relies on external provers to work. You must install
them first, then point CAISAR to their location. Please
refer to each prover documentation to install them.

CAISAR
already support several provers, listed in
:ref:`overalldesign`.
Assuming you have installed a prover with an entry in the
``caisar-detection.conf`` file, you can register the prover to CAISAR using the
following command: ``PATH=$PATH:/path/to/solver/executable caisar config -d``.
Your prover should be displayed with its relevant version.

Property verification
---------------------
A prominent use case of CAISAR is to model a specification for an artificial intelligence
system, and to verify its validity for a given system.

The modelling uses `WhyML <https://why3.lri.fr/doc/syntaxref.html>`_,
a typed first-order logic language.
Example of WhyML are in the `source code <https://git.frama-c.com/pub/caisar/-/tree/master/examples/>`_.
You may also read the :ref:`examples` section of this
documentation to get a first grasp on using WhyML.

Provided a file ``trust.why`` containing a goal to verify, the command ``caisar verify --prover=PROVER trust.why``
will verify the goals using the specified prover. A list of
supported provers is available in :ref:`overalldesign`. The prover
must already be registered by CAISAR. Currently, only one
prover can be selected at a time; future work will allow
selecting multiple provers and orchestrate verification
strategies.
Internally, CAISAR will translate the goals into a form that
is acceptable by the targeted prover, generating a file (the
``%f`` defined in the previous section).

Logging
*******

CAISAR provides different log verbosity levels. To change the log verbosity
level, provide the option ``--verbosity`` to the ``verify`` command. Available
levels are ``quiet``, ``error``, ``warning``, ``info`` and ``debug`` (defaults
to ``warning``).

CAISAR also provides log *tags*. Each tag adds additional information in the
log, independently of the log verbosity level. However, note that the ``debug``
verbosity level allows logging with all tags enabled. To enable a particular
tag, use the option ``--ltag=TAG``, with ``TAG`` one of the following:

* ``Autodetect``: display the output of the autodetect routine of CAISAR described in :ref:`prover-registration`
* ``ProverSpec``: display the actual specification provided to the prover
* ``ProverCall``: display the actual command used to call the prover
* ``InterpretGoal``: display the goal interpretation
* ``StackTrace``: display the stack trace upon a CAISAR error

Built-in properties
-------------------
In addition to all the theories provided by Why3, CAISAR
provide additional theories that model commonly desirable properties for machine learning programs.
All those predicates are located in the file ``stdlib/caisar.mlw``.
Among them are theories to describe classification datasets,
local and global robustness around a neighborhood.

Advanced usage: registering a new prover
----------------------------------------

Provers tend to be complex programs with multiple options.
Some combination of options may be suited for one
verification problem, while inefficient for another. As they
also have different interface, it is also necessary to register
their call in a way CAISAR can understand.
To do so, you must register provers inside the ``config/caisar-detection-data.conf`` file.
Each supported prover is registered by specifying the following fields:

* ``name``: the name under which CAISAR will know the prover
* ``exec``: the prover's executable name
* ``alternative`` (optional): an alternative configuration for the
  prover. To use it with CAISAR, use the option
  ``--prover-altern``. Useful when you want to use the same
  prover on different problems.
* ``version_switch``: the command used to output the prover's
  version
* ``version_regexp``: a regular expression parsing the
  output of ``version_switch``
* ``version_ok``: CAISAR supported version of the prover.
  Provers should only be used with their supported version.
* ``command``: the actual command CAISAR will send to the prover executable. There are a few builtin expressions provided by CAISAR:

  * ``%f``: the generated property file sent to the prover
  * ``%t``: the timelimit value
  * ``%{nnet-onnx}``: the name of the neural network file
* ``driver``: location of the CAISAR driver for the prover, if any

If you add support for a new prover, consider opening a merge

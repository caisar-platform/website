Foreword
========

CAISAR is a platform for the Characterization of Artificial Intelligence Safety
And Robustness. It supports an expressive modelling language that allows the
specification of a wide variety of properties to enforce on a machine learning
system, and relies on external provers to discharge verification conditions.

Overall Design
--------------

CAISAR uses the `Why3 <https://why3.lri.fr/>`_ platform, as a library, to
provide both the specification language, called WhyML, and the infrastructure
needed to interoperate with external provers. These are generally called
*provers*, although some of them do not directly provide a logical proof.

The supported provers are the following:

* `PyRAT <https://laiser.frama-c.com/laiser-websites/pyrat-website/>`_, a neural
  network verifier based on abstract interpretation,
* `Marabou <https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou>`_, a
  Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver specialized in neural network
  verification,
* `SAVer <https://github.com/abstract-machine-learning/saver>`_, a support
  vector machine verifier based on abstract interpretation,
* `nnenum <https://github.com/stanleybak/nnenum>`_ a neural network verifier
  that combines abstract interpretation and linear programming techniques,
* Standard SAT/SMT solvers that support the SMT-LIBv2 input language.

CAISAR aims to be component-agnostic: it can model and assess the
trustworthiness of artificial intelligence system that potentially mixes both
symbolic- and data-driven approaches. It supports the verification of properties
for multiple machine learning models. Neural Network (NN) are handled through
the `ONNX <https://onnx.ai/>`_ exchange format. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
are supported through an ad-hoc CSV format.

The motivations and design ideas behind CAISAR have been presented at the
workshop `AISafety 2022 <https://www.aisafetyw.org/>`_ [GABCL2022]_.

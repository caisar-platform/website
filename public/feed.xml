<p>We are happy to announce the release of CAISAR 0.2, to celebrate the 234th birthday of the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume">Serment du jeu de Paume</a>. On this day, courageous people took a vow to abolish autocracy and fight for their rights.
This release is the result of more than one year of work.
Here are some of the most prominent changes that we are
happy to share.
The release is available under our <a href="https://git.frama-c.com/pub/caisar/">gitlab</a>, on <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/caisar/">opam</a> and on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/laiser/caisar">Dockerhub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-prover-support">New prover support</h2>
<p>We added the support of several provers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/stanleybak/nnenum">alpha-beta-CROWN</a> prover; winner of the 2021 and 2022 edition of the VNN-COMP</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/stanleybak/nnenum">nnenum</a> prover</li>
  <li>the AIMOS metamorphic testing prover, for now internally
developped at CEA</li>
</ul>

<p>We also added support to the <a href="https://www.vnnlib.org/">VNNLib</a> standard. In the future, adding a VNNLib compliant prover to CAISAR would only require to edit two small files, which is a huge step towards integrating more provers.
This also results in supporting all solvers that support the
SMTLIB2 language (which VNNLib is a subset of). We
implemented a custom transformation in CAISAR that
automatically translates the neural network control flow
into a SMT formula. This custom transformation had been
tested for the <a href="https://cvc5.github.io/">CVC5 solver</a>.</p>

<h2 id="manual">Manual</h2>

<p>The first version of the CAISAR manual is available under the <a href="/website/documentation/">documentation</a> section of the website. It includes detailed installation instructions, a synopsis of common commands and two tutorials on classical benchmarks. The current version of those tutorials make use of experimental features that we plan to document in a future release. We hope this manual will provide a good entry point to CAISAR, and formal verification of machine learning programs at large.</p>

<h2 id="usability">Usability</h2>

<p>We added various utilities to make CAISAR slicker to use,
such as several logging options, verification through a JSON
file, and reworked help messages.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CAISAR 0.2 release We are happy to announce the release of CAISAR 0.2, to celebrate the 234th birthday of the Serment du jeu de Paume.

<p>The JFLA (French for <em>Journées Francophones des Langages
Applicatifs</em>) is a yearly meeting of both academics and
industrials that share a common interest on functional
programming - and incidently, software verification.</p>

<p>Industry side, companies <a href="https://ocamlpro.com/fr/">OCamlpro</a>,
<a href="https://fr.mitsubishielectric.com/fr/">Mitshubishi
Electric</a>,
<a href="https://trust-in-soft.com/">TrustInSoft</a> were present. From
the academia, people from <a href="https://lmf.cnrs.fr/?lang=en">Formal Methods
Laboratory</a>,
<a href="https://www.ensiie.fr/">ENSIIE</a> and <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">INRIA</a> were attending.</p>

<p>We gave a 15-minute presentation of CAISAR, available <a href="/website/assets/Girard_Satabin_JFLA2023_CAISAR.pdf">here
(in French)</a>.
The relevant publication is available <a href="https://hal.science/hal-03936881/document">here (also in French)</a>.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure to receive constructive feedback,
both by industrial and academic actors; as it will inform
our current and future work on the platform.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CAISAR featured during JFLA]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Release of the technical paper</title><link href="https://caisar-platform.github.io/website/2022/06/02/news.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Release of the technical paper" /><published>2022-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://caisar-platform.github.io/website/2022/06/02/news</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://caisar-platform.github.io/website/2022/06/02/news.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="caisars-technical-report">CAISAR’s technical report</h1>

          <p>AIMOS (AI Metamorphism Observing Software) is a tool which goal
is to provide the means to test metamorphic properties on a dataset
for a given AI model. The approach is black-box as the intrinsic
characteristics of the AI model is not used in any way,
as the model is treated as a black-box oracle with
only its inference function.</p>

          <p>Its approach improves the usual approaches which only test a model against a
perturbation without considering its output. Indeed, a transformation on the
input space can also be linked to a transformation on the output space,
<em>e.g.</em> a symmetry on the input can mean a symmetry on the outputs as well
(a left arrow becoming a right arrow, <em>etc.</em>).
AIMOS implements this approach, thus allowing the user to provide more flexible
and complete property testing.
As the tool is agnostic of the model type used, this allows the approach and
framework to compare different types of models or architectures and, in turn, to
provide incentives for a choice between one type or another. As such, this
permits comparisons between similar models types but with different
architectures (<em>e.g.</em> 1 Convolution vs 2 Convolution layers) but also between
very different architectures (<em>e.g.</em> Neural Networks vs SVMs vs Decision Trees)
in similar settings or also of simply differently trained models.</p>

          <p>The aim of this tool is to rapidly and widely test a given AI model on a given
dataset. This testing can serve to exhibit inefficiencies of the models, compare
them to gauge the most stable ones, <em>etc</em>. Thus, AIMOS can be an important part
of an AI development process, providing a framework to facilitate and automate a
rapid testing procedure. The metamorphic properties themselves, as part of the
testing procedure, should be carefully selected to provide a good criterion of
evaluation for the model when tested with AIMOS. For instance, if the problem
represented by the AI model does not present any axe of symmetry, it would be of
little value to test it against that.</p>

          <p>The Python Reachability Analysis Tool (PyRAT) is a
  neural network verification tool developed internally at
  CEA. It is based on the technique called abstract interpretation.</p>

          <p>PyRAT aims to
  determine whether a certain state can be reached in a given neural network.
  To do so, it propagates different types of abstract domains along
  the different layers of the neural network up until the output layer.
  This technique overapproximates some of the layer’s
  operations, thus the output space reached will always be bigger than the exact
  output space, providing sound reasoning.
  If the output space reached is inside a certain space
  defining the property we want, then we can say that the property
  is verified. Otherwise, we cannot conclude.</p>

          <p>PyRAT leverages state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks
  to efficiently compute high-dimensional data, and supports a
  vast range of neural network architectures.</p>

          <p>PyRAT is one of the verifier CAISAR uses to compute <em>local robustness</em>
  properties or <em>safety</em> properties.</p>

<p class="title"> Marabou </p>
<div>
          <p>(the following is adapted from Marabou’s <a href="https://neuralnetworkverification.github.io/">official
  website</a> )</p>

          <p>Marabou is an SMT-based tool that answers queries about
  neural networks and their properties.
  Queries are transformed into constraint satisfaction problems.
  Marabou takes as input networks with various piece-wise
  linear activation functions and with fully connected topology.</p>

          <p>Marabou first applies multiple pre-processing steps to infer bounds
  for each node in the network.
  Next it applies a combination of Simplex search over linear
  constraints with SMT techniques directing the search over non-linear
  constraints. Marabou also implements Split-and-Conquer mode,
  which decomposes the verification query into a set of smaller queries,
  which can be solved in parallel.</p>

          <p>CAISAR uses Marabou for solving complex queries.</p>
